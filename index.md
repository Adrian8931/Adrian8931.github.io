### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    In lab 4 my favorite part was the increased difficulty. The amount of code we had to write out was more than the previous labs. The first part of the lab we prompted the user for numbers and used those numbers to calculate the Gregorian dates. I was challenged a little more and I was curious as to what the next labs would bring. 

* Lab 10

    My favorite part of lab 10 was the partner I worked with. We had worked together before so we worked even better together on this lab. We were able to work well together on the three parts of this lab that involved multiple files. I learned about good teamwork when coding and I learned from my partner as well. 

* Lab 11

    In lab 11 my favorite part was that we revisited the "Hilo" game. We had done it previously but this time the code was spread out across files and it was made to be much more complex than the first version. It showed me how simple or complex a game could be depending on how you code it.
